- date: The date where the event occurred, in the format (mm-dd-yyyy), depending on the information you have. Only add events for which you have specific dates. Ensure you give me specific months and years. Do not give date ranges.
- event: A one-liner highlighting the relevant event. This can go up to 30 words.
- image_gen_prompt: A few word prompt that can be used for generating a relevant image on a Text2Image model like Dall-E. Ensure prompts are not violent. Keep this less than 10 words.

Make sure you only use the information from the article, and if there is no extractable event, don't create a JSON entry for it. Only give me the JSON, no other text. Try to pick the up to the 3 most important dates, as much as possible."""
